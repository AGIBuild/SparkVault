# Contributing

Thank you for helping SparkVault turn sparks into catalytic systems.

## Ways to Contribute
1. Propose a new idea (use the idea intake Issue form).
2. Enrich an existing idea (add context, risks, precedents).
3. Suggest a prototype (link shortlisted idea + outline Minimum Viable Experiment).
4. Help evaluate (comment with evidence, scoring rationale).
5. Maintenance (identify stale ideas, propose archiving or consolidation).

## Idea Workflow
Capture -> Enrich -> Score -> Shortlist -> Prototype -> Archive

## Principles
- Evidence over assertion.
- Clarify assumptions vs validated facts.
- Preserve original author intent; extend via new sections or Revision Notes.
- Ethical awareness: privacy, equity, accessibility.

## Submitting
- Use front-matter fields in `IDEA-TEMPLATE.md`.
- Keep slugs short, lowercase, hyphen-separated.
- Commit message convention: `idea: add <slug>` or `idea: enrich <slug>`.

## Scoring Guidance (Indicative)
Impact, Feasibility, Novelty, Urgency, Alignment (1-5 scale). Provide brief rationale in comments.

## Prototype Proposals
Include: scope, success metric, resources, timebox, risks, next validation step.

## Quarterly Review
Re-score active ideas; move outdated to `status: archived`; surface consolidation opportunities.

## Code of Conduct
See `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
