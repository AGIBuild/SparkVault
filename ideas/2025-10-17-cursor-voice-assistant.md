# Cursor Voice Assistant
Add a speech-driven conversational layer to Cursor so users interact with in-editor agents using natural spoken language.

## Problem
Developers often context-switch between typing, reading code, and conceptual planning. Manual prompt typing slows exploration, especially when hands are busy (pairing, hardware tinkering) or when rapid iterative clarification is needed. Accessibility users also benefit from low-friction verbal interaction.

## Insight
Real-time, low-latency speech-to-action loops can compress the prompt->response cycle and surface clarifying follow-ups immediately. Voice modality can capture intent faster ("refactor just the sorting part to use a min-heap") than typed multi-sentence prompts.

## Concept
Integrate a lightweight voice assistant pane / overlay in Cursor:
- Push-to-talk (keyboard shortcut or hold key) starts capture.
- Streaming ASR converts speech to structured intent + raw transcript.
- NLU layer post-processes transcript: extract commands ("open file", "explain function", "generate tests").
- Agent responds via text in editor + optional TTS playback.
- Follow-up chaining: system keeps short-term conversational state per file buffer.
- Privacy mode: local/offline model option (fallback to cloud if allowed).

### Interaction Flows (draft)
1. Quick Refactor: User presses shortcut, says "extract the loop in processData into a helper" → transcript → agent suggests diff.
2. Code Explanation: "Explain the error handling in this file" → identifies current file context → summary.
3. Generation: "Write unit tests for the parseHeader function" → agent generates test skeletons.
4. Navigation: "Open the config file" → triggers file search.

## Potential Impact
- Productivity: Faster prompt cycles; reduce ~30–50% keystrokes for exploratory/refactor tasks.
- Accessibility: Empower voice-reliant users to engage deeper with AI-assisted coding.
- Adoption: Differentiates Cursor with multimodal augmentation.
- Knowledge capture: Spoken clarifications could be logged (opt-in) to improve future suggestions.

## Feasibility Notes
- ASR options: OpenAI Realtime, Whisper local, Vosk, Coqui STT.
- Latency target: <800ms partial transcript display.
- TTS: Edge / ElevenLabs / local models if needed.
- Complexity: Need command grammar or lightweight intent classifier (prompt-based or small finetuned model).
- Risks: Mis-recognition leads to wrong code changes; mitigate via confirmation step for write operations.
- Dependencies: Editor integration API, microphone access, streaming websockets.

## Evolution Ideas
- Phase 1: Passive transcript + manual "Send to agent" button.
- Phase 2: Streaming intent classification and immediate agent response.
- Phase 3: Inline diff preview with voice confirmation "apply".
- Phase 4: Context summarization of a file via "summarize this file".
- Phase 5: Multi-agent arbitration: "compare two implementation styles".

## Status
Current status: draft.
